# holochain-forum-theme (light)

## How to deploy

1. Push your changes on this branch to the GitHub repo.
2. Log on to https://forum.holochain.org/admin/customize/themes with an account that has admin privileges.
3. Click the **Light** theme in the left sidebar.
4. Click the **Check for Updates** button. You should see a message saying that the theme is ? commits ahead.
5. The Check for Updates button should now say **Update Theme** or something similar. Click it.
6. You and all the others will probably need a hard refresh before you see any changes.

## This isn't all there is!

There is another branch, `dark`, which holds a dark variant of this theme (naturally). It's based off this branch, and any time you make changes to this theme (except to the theme colours, of course) you should merge those changes into the `dark` branch too.
