## How to deploy

2. Log on to https://forum.holochain.org/admin/customize/themes with an account that has admin privileges.
3. ???

## This isn't all there is!

There is another branch, `dark`, which holds a dark variant of this theme (naturally). It's based off this branch, and any time you make changes to this theme (except to the theme colours, of course) you should merge those changes into the `dark` branch too.
