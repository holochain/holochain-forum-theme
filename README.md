# holochain-forum-theme (dark)

## How to deploy

1. Push your changes on this branch to the GitHub repo.
2. Log on to https://forum.holochain.org/admin/customize/themes with an account that has admin privileges.
3. ???

## This isn't all there is!

There is another branch, `light`, which holds the original of this theme. This branch is based on the other, and any time you make changes to the other theme (except to the theme colours, of course) you should merge those changes into this branch too. This means that you should **never edit HTML and CSS in this branch!** Always do it in the `light` branch and merge to this branch.
